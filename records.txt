Measurements for 30 iterations of 0th generation
Note that each iteration had a typical score of 8 to 12.
    Uncapping FPS:
        147.70 s -> 19.96 s (7.4x improvement)
    Headless:
        19.96 s -> 0.83 s

    Assuming that a typical run when the network has been trained takes 10x longer,
    And that performance scales perfectly with 32 cores,
    It takes 0.83 * 10 / 30 / 32 == 0.0086 seconds per iteration.

    Let's run each Breaker 5 times, for example, so that the middle 3 values can be averaged for the fitness.

    If we have n Breakers in each generation,
    we run 5 * n iterations total, giving 0.0086 * 5 * n == 0.043 * n.
    Let's just say (0.05 * n) seconds for each generation

    If we want to limit each generation to about 1 minute,
    we get n == 1200.
    I don't think that a larger population size will be critical in the end result,
    so let's have n == 1024 to make things nice.

Testing scalingg with multiprocessing
    1 process, n=1024 at gen 0 took 35 seconds.
    32 processes, n=1024 at gen 0 took 2.9 seconds.
    --> This is a 12x improvement. Hmm..

    1 process, n=4096 at gen 0 took 139 seconds.
    16 processes, n=4096 at gen 0 took 15.3 seconds.
    32 processes, n=4096 at gen 0 took 11.4 seconds.
    --> Still a 12x improvement. I guess this is what the truth is.
